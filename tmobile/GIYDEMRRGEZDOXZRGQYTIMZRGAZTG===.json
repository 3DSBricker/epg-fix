Zakaria goes deep inside the Supreme Court's deliberations over abortion rights, with new details on Chief Justice John Robert's furious fight to stop the Conservative bloc of Justices from overturning Roe v Wade. With top legal scholars and court insiders, Zakaria examines just how dramatic and unprecedented some of the Court's latest decisions are - and warns of a little-known case in the next session that may be even more controversial than Roe. He then traces the history of the Court through the Twentieth Century, from Franklin Roosevelt's court battles to the transformative changes of the Warren Court to the ugly Confirmation hearings of the last few decades - to draw a clear line to the present moment, revealing exactly how America came to have its most Conservative court in a century.","category":""},"55192":{"channel":"141431033","start":"1669564800","end":"1669568400","first":"C","idtitle":"CNNNEWSROOMSUNDAY","title":"CNN Newsroom Sunday","program_id":"1298827012","date":"","icon":"https:\/\/t-mobiletv.nl:443\/CPS\/images\/universal\/film\/program\/202211\/20221120\/14\/202211200901097940fe.jpg","description":"Updates of the latest news from around the world.","category":""},"55193":{"channel":"141431033","start":"1669568400","end":"1669570200","first":"W","idtitle":"WORLDSPORT","title":"World Sport","program_id":"1298827018","date":"","icon":"https:\/\/t-mobiletv.nl:443\/CPS\/images\/universal\/film\/program\/202211\/20221120\/54\/20221120090109794vzv.jpg","description":"A comprehensive review of sports news from around the world, including all the key highlights, profiles and interviews with the newsmakers and stars of sport.","category":""},"55194":{"channel":"141431033","start":"1669570200","end":"1669572000","first":"I","idtitle":"INSIDEAFRICA","title":"Inside Africa","program_id":"1298827024","date":"","icon":"https:\/\/t-mobiletv.nl:443\/CPS\/images\/universal\/film\/program\/202211\/20221120\/38\/20221120090109794vqj.jpg","description":"As the alternative meat movement takes root worldwide, a new generation of entrepreneurs is promoting different diets and lifestyles.","category":""},"55195":{"channel":"141431033","start":"1669572000","end":"1669573800","first":"S","idtitle":"SPECIAL","title":"Special","program_id":"1298827030","date":"","icon":"https:\/\/t-mobiletv.nl:443\/CPS\/images\/universal\/film\/program\/202211\/20221120\/27\/202211200901097951aq.jpg","description":"With many entrepreneurs excited to turn ideas into solutions, Abu Dhabi's infrastructure is designed to help startups thrive through designated hubs, incubators, and accelerators.","category":""},"55196":{"channel":"141431033","start":"1669573800","end":"1669575600","first":"A","idtitle":"AFRICANVOICESCHANGEMAKERS","title":"African Voices Changemakers","program_id":"1298827036","date":"","icon":"https:\/\/t-mobiletv.nl:443\/CPS\/images\/universal\/film\/program\/202211\/20221120\/66\/20221120090109795tpc.jpg","description":"An ophthalmologist restores sight to hundreds of people in Namibia for free; in South Africa, a neurosurgeon breaks boundaries and inspires others to join her field.","category":""},"55197":{"channel":"141431033","start":"1669575600","end":"1669579200","first":"C","idtitle":"CNNNEWSROOMSUNDAY","title":"CNN Newsroom Sunday","program_id":"1298827042","date":"","icon":"https:\/\/t-mobiletv.nl:443\/CPS\/images\/universal\/film\/program\/202211\/20221120\/37\/20221120090109795quc.jpg","description":"Updates of the latest news from around the world.","category":""},"55198":{"channel":"141431033","start":"1669579200","end":"1669582800","first":"C","idtitle":"CNNNEWSROOMSUNDAY","title":"CNN Newsroom Sunday","program_id":"1298827048","date":"","icon":"https:\/\/t-mobiletv.nl:443\/CPS\/images\/universal\/film\/program\/202211\/20221120\/17\/20221120090109795a7h.jpg","description":"Updates of the latest news from around the world.","category":""},"55199":{"channel":"141431033","start":"1669582800","end":"1669586400","first":"C","idtitle":"CNNNEWSROOMSUNDAY","title":"CNN Newsroom Sunday","program_id":"1300880340","date":"","icon":"https:\/\/t-mobiletv.nl:443\/CPS\/images\/universal\/film\/program\/202211\/20221125\/5\/20221125090134715cyq.jpg","description":"Updates of the latest news from around the world.","category":""},"55200":{"channel":"141431033","start":"1669586400","end":"1669588200","first":"W","idtitle":"WORLDSPORT","title":"World Sport","program_id":"1298827072","date":"","icon":"https:\/\/t-mobiletv.nl:443\/CPS\/images\/universal\/film\/program\/202211\/20221120\/67\/202211200901097959yy.jpg","description":"A comprehensive review of sports news from around the world, including all the key highlights, profiles and interviews with the newsmakers and stars of sport.","category":""},"55201":{"channel":"141431033","start":"1669588200","end":"1669590000","first":"Q","idtitle":"QUESTSWORLDOFWONDER","title":"Quest's World of Wonder","program_id":"1298827078","date":"","icon":"https:\/\/t-mobiletv.nl:443\/CPS\/images\/universal\/film\/program\/202211\/20221120\/61\/20221120090109795sw5.jpg","description":"Dublin is graced with beautiful landscapes, a spirit that makes you want to sing along and traditions that hearken back to a forgotten time.","category":""}}

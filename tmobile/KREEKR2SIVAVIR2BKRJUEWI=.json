Scott Fitzgerald`s landmark novel, The Great Gatsby, with blockbuster star Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role.

Soon, Nick is drawn into the captivating world of the super-rich, their illusions, loves and deceits. Bearing witness to this new world, Nick pens a tale of impossible love, incorruptible dreams and unforgettable tragedy - mirroring our own times and struggles.","category":""}}

Produced by George Clooney and Grant Heslov's Smokehouse Pictures (Ides of March), this hostage rescue picture follows CIA \"exfiltration\" operative and master of disguise Tony Mendez (Affleck), who sets out to rescue a handful of American diplomats hiding out in 1979 Tehran. Pretending to be a film location scouting crew, Mendez and a motley crew of Hollywood artists, escape artists and con-artists smuggle the six embassy workers to safety in a daring rescue. With a supporting cast that includes Oscar\u00ae winner Alan Arkin, Golden Globe winner John Goodman and Emmy\u00ae winner Bryan Cranston, Affleck's political satire represents an \"escape\" into a real-world caper.","category":""}}

He then traces the history of the Court through the Twentieth Century, from Franklin Roosevelt's court battles to the transformative changes of the Warren Court to the ugly Confirmation hearings of the last few decades - to draw a clear line to the present moment, revealing exactly how America came to have its most Conservative court in a century.","category":""},"62930":{"channel":"45","start":"1669604400","end":"1669606200","first":"A","idtitle":"AFRICANVOICESCHANGEMAKERS","title":"African Voices Changemakers","program_id":"899476752","date":"","icon":"https:\/\/images.tv.kpn.com\/epg\/8A6Zxh3d8C35RxlXwGCmhpR75FS835AteneaxaHU08U\/1920x1080.jpg?blurred=false","description":"An ophthalmologist restores sight to hundreds of people in Namibia for free; in South Africa, a neurosurgeon breaks boundaries and inspires others to join her field.","category":""},"62931":{"channel":"45","start":"1669606200","end":"1669607100","first":"M","idtitle":"MARKETPLACEAFRICA","title":"Marketplace Africa","program_id":"899476755","date":"","icon":"https:\/\/images.tv.kpn.com\/epg\/RaUExEdjoqk9BUrQ9Cq8pwk1hOjRyeCyPf7XtrfO4GPac\/1920x1080.jpg?blurred=false","description":"What's needed to sustain growth in Ivory Coast's real estate industry; the future of construction materials and why Africa is an integral piece of the company's global operations.","category":""},"62932":{"channel":"45","start":"1669607100","end":"1669608000","first":"M","idtitle":"MARKETPLACEEUROPE","title":"Marketplace Europe","program_id":"899476758","date":"","icon":"https:\/\/images.tv.kpn.com\/epg\/l8kMS5V0xYAhXcFIGX9CzaEVJYLcOj6oSdZpv9COm19ASY\/1920x1080.jpg?blurred=false","description":"Anna Stewart explores the latest and greatest on display at Europe's biggest technology expo, from the metaverse to solar-powered cars.","category":""},"62933":{"channel":"45","start":"1669608000","end":"1669609800","first":"L","idtitle":"LIVINGGOLF","title":"Living Golf","program_id":"899476761","date":"","icon":"https:\/\/images.tv.kpn.com\/epg\/GpThgBUjYDzLbC3eXcbAkCFFy0Ai5OT8MtHEbf7kRcs\/1920x1080.jpg?blurred=false","description":"Golf technology is constantly evolving, from cutting edge military technology used in launch monitors to games in the metaverse.

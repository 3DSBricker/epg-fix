Elder Chick is the MC for the day and says that she is loving Love Monster’s party spirit, but she warns him to make sure he saves some energy for the grand finale conga at the end of the day. Love Monster throws himself into some high-energy party games. He leaps into a ball pit and swims across it, swirls three hula hoops around himself at once, bounces up and down and even off the bouncy castle walls, and eventually lands momentarily on a beanbag, a little out of breath. Soon, Love Monster is feeling tired. He spots a beanbag and closes his eyes, drifting off into a nap. A short while later, he wakes up to hear the conga music in the distance. He leaps up full of energy to join the conga and lead the Fluffytowners in his favourite activity, shimmying and shaking into the sunset. Sometimes, if you take a little break, you’ll recharge your shimmy and your shake.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20221119064000 +0000" stop="20221119065500 +0000" catchup-id="1295471473"><title>Go Jetters</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202211/20221112/64/20221112090049823xkb.jpg"></icon><desc>When the Go Jetters find the Grimbots shipping overripe tomatoes into the Spanish town of Bunol, they put a stop to whatever Glitch is up to - until they find out that the tomatoes were destined for the famous Tomatina Festival, the biggest food fight in the world.

Using groundbreaking artificial intelligence to protect the identities of the protesters, this film tells the story of four young people locked in a brutal battle with the authorities to defend their way of life. As the police response turns deadly, the protesters respond with violence of their own. Families turn against each other, and the city is brought to its knees, but the protesters feel they are fighting for their freedom and refuse to give in. Holed up in a university campus, surrounded by police and with little response from the government, the protesters make their final stand. Meanwhile, Beijing is preparing a crackdown that will change the face of Hong Kong forever.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20221121220000 +0000" stop="20221121223000 +0000" catchup-id="1296255216"><title>Motherland</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202211/20221114/99/20221114090055524v9o.jpg"></icon><desc>Mother's Day leaves Julia feeling ignored while Meg gets spoilt rotten.

Tonight, they must prove themselves to Anna and Marcus in two challenges that would unnerve even the most experienced chefs. First, Anna and Marcus set the contenders an Invention Test with a twist. They must create a dish that showcases as many different textures as possible using a larder that includes seafood, fish, meat, fruit, vegetables, spices, nuts, pastas and pulses. Starting from scratch, who will best use the 70 minutes to deliver a plate full of contrasting textures that also tastes delicious? Next, the chefs must raise their game yet again when they cook for food writers Leyla Kazim, William Sitwell and Grace Dent. With a two-course menu of their own design, this is their chance to catch the eye of three people whose word can make or break careers. Only the most talented chefs will make it through to the semi-finals.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20221123090000 +0000" stop="20221123100000 +0000" catchup-id="1297128498"><title>BBC News</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202211/20221116/87/20221116090119710nfq.jpg"></icon><desc>The latest headlines, breaking news and sport from the BBC newsroom.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20221123100000 +0000" stop="20221123111500 +0000" catchup-id="1297128504"><title>BBC News</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202211/20221116/58/20221116090119710f0e.jpg"></icon><desc>Twenty-four hours a day, the latest national and international stories as they break.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20221123111500 +0000" stop="20221123130000 +0000" catchup-id="1297128510"><title>Politics Live</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202211/20221116/83/202211160901197106ac.jpg"></icon><desc>The big political issues of the day.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20221123130000 +0000" stop="20221123134500 +0000" catchup-id="1297128516"><title>Best House in Town</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202211/20221116/53/202211160901197103yo.jpg"></icon><desc>The owners of three wildcard properties hand over their keys to a team of discerning neighbours in the hope of being judged to have the best house in town.

Using groundbreaking artificial intelligence to protect the identities of the protesters, this film tells the story of four young people locked in a brutal battle with the authorities to defend their way of life. As the police response turns deadly, the protesters respond with violence of their own. Families turn against each other, and the city is brought to its knees, but the protesters feel they are fighting for their freedom and refuse to give in. Holed up in a university campus, surrounded by police and with little response from the government, the protesters make their final stand. Meanwhile, Beijing is preparing a crackdown that will change the face of Hong Kong forever.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20221126003500 +0000" stop="20221126010500 +0000" catchup-id="1298417076"><title>Cost of Living: Can’t Afford My Home – Panorama</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202211/20221119/39/20221119090119724e4w.jpg"></icon><desc>What does the winter hold for people struggling to get a home, or hold on to the one they already have?

Jeffery secured a $300,000 advance against the promise of a soundtrack album by Hendrix - the first time a movie was funded solely by an album. But without a script or professional actors, the shoot proved to be one of excess. With The Jimi Hendrix Experience already booked to play Honolulu, director Chuck Wein planned to film them playing on the slope of the dormant Haleakala volcano. Whilst the show was a stunning success, the same could not be said for Rainbow Bridge.

From their beginnings as a primitive system of track-ways for coal carts in the early 18th century, railways quickly developed into the driving force behind the industrial revolution and the pivotal technology for modern Britain. Rapid industrial growth during the early 19th century, coupled with the prospect of vast profits, drove inventors and entrepreneurs to develop steam locomotives, metal tracks and an array of daring tunnels, cuttings and bridges that created a nationwide system of railways in just 30 years. George Stephenson's Liverpool and Manchester Railway became the model for future inter-city travel for the next century and his fast, reliable locomotive, the Rocket, began a quest for speed that has defined our modern world.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20221127165000 +0000" stop="20221127173000 +0000" catchup-id="1298801499"><title>Flog It!</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202211/20221120/98/20221120090039721dfg.jpg"></icon><desc>This Flog It! comes from Guildford Cathedral, one of the few cathedrals to be built in the 20th century.

Railway tycoons like Samuel Morton Peto and George Hudson made fortunes as the stock markets boomed. But the bubble burst in 1847 and shares plummeted.

Travelling alone, Isabella crossed the lawless American Wild West, riding 800 miles on horseback through the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. She befriended outlaws, climbed mountains, and faced grizzly bears in what was a restrictive era for women in Britain. Using her original 1873 book A Lady's Life in the Rocky Mountains as inspiration for their own adventure, Ruby, Mel and Emily want to pay homage to this forgotten pioneer.

The next morning, the car was found abandoned, balanced precariously on the edge of a quarry. Ten days later, Agatha was discovered in a hotel in Harrogate, claiming to have lost her memory.

She visits the key locations, from the chalk pit where Agatha crashed her car to Abney Hall, the grand house where she took refuge (and which would inspire several of her books).
